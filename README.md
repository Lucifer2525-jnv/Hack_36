A Repo of Hack36 On Women Security!
This project is Based upon IoT and Web integrity!

************************* Project Idea *****************************************
We tried to make a IOT setup which could be embedded inside Ornaments(Ring, Bracelets & Necklace etc..) or any asthetical women's wearing.
Our IoT system include couple of sensors and physical buttons placed at tricky place with embedded ornaments which is subject to be designed.
This IoT system do have Microcontroller to Get sensors & buttons readings along with a NodeMCU ESP8266 Wifi-Module and GSM module & GPS Module which will perform respective tasks when any sensor or button got trigrred by any women under adverse scenerio.
our idea is to generate a Post response from out sensors for invoking Web-Services which would immediately send her LOCATION to her contacts(nearby) via SMS & Whatsapp along with a PhoneCall alert using an API.
Also we have designed a webPage where the POST response of IOT will be parsed and respective location along with essential details will be recorded for anf future requirements as reference for any legal action.

************************* HoW TO SIMULATE ***************************************
All source codes for IOT along with their circuit diagram are commited in repo....do take care to provide the required HEX-CODE to every IoT modules used in, if required to them individually(HEX_CODE are given in repo by Modules name) before starting SIMULATION.
Note- We preferred and Tested all Our simulations on "Proteus"....which we highly recommed to avoid any library constraint rather you may use any simulation platform if have adequate command over it to deal with any constraint.
If using Proteus then remember compling the Arduino Code and the exporting its HEX-Code to some location...since that location path will be required to be given to Arduino before simulation.
